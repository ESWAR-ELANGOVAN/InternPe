# Tic Tac Toe Game Implementation in Python with Tkinter

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game supports a two-player mode and provides a user-friendly GUI to make moves and display game results.

## Features
- Classic Tic Tac Toe gameplay with two-player mode.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) with clickable buttons to make moves.
- Real-time updates on the player's turn and game results.
- Option to restart the game after a win or draw.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the Tkinter library installed.
3. Run the "tic_tac_toe.py" script to start the game.
4. The game board will be displayed in a window with clickable buttons representing each cell.
5. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to make their moves.
6. The game will automatically check for winning combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals after each move.
7. When a player wins or the board is full (a draw), the game will end, and a message will be displayed.
8. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game after a win or draw.

## Future Enhancements
I plan to enhance this project by adding an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm, which will challenge players in single-player mode. Additionally, I'm looking to improve the visual aspects of the game, including animations and custom styling.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- Tkinter (included with standard Python installation)
